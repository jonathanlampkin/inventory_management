## Price Elasticity Analysis

Price elasticity measures how sensitive demand is to changes in price.
- Elasticity < -1: Elastic (demand is highly sensitive to price)
- Elasticity > -1: Inelastic (demand is less sensitive to price)

### Category Elasticity

| Category | Price Elasticity | Recommendation |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Groceries | 0.98 | Consider price increase, demand is highly inelastic |
| Toys | 7.15 | Consider price increase, demand is highly inelastic |
| Electronics | 17.24 | Consider price increase, demand is highly inelastic |
| Furniture | -0.36 | Consider price increase, demand is highly inelastic |
| Clothing | 17.98 | Consider price increase, demand is highly inelastic |

## Discount Strategy

The optimal discount level across all products is **0.0%**, which generates an average revenue of **$7465.53** per transaction.

## Competitive Pricing Strategy

The optimal price differential compared to competitors is **-2% to 0%**, which generates an average revenue of **$8352.65** per transaction.

## Strategic Pricing Initiatives

1. **Dynamic Pricing**: Implement dynamic pricing for highly elastic products
2. **Price Skimming**: For inelastic categories, gradually decrease prices from initial high points
3. **Penetration Pricing**: For elastic categories, start with lower prices to gain market share
4. **Psychological Pricing**: Use price points ending in .99 for elastic products
5. **Bundle Pricing**: Create bundles for complementary products, especially with elastic items
6. **Price Anchoring**: Display premium products alongside standard offerings to increase perception of value
7. **Seasonal Adjustments**: Adjust pricing strategies by season based on the seasonality analysis

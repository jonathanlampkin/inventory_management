## Price Elasticity Analysis

Price elasticity measures how sensitive demand is to changes in price.
- Elasticity < -1: Elastic (demand is highly sensitive to price)
- Elasticity > -1: Inelastic (demand is less sensitive to price)

### Category Elasticity

| Category | Price Elasticity | Recommendation |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Groceries | -0.00 | Consider price increase, demand is highly inelastic |
| Toys | -0.01 | Consider price increase, demand is highly inelastic |
| Electronics | 0.02 | Consider price increase, demand is highly inelastic |
| Furniture | 0.03 | Consider price increase, demand is highly inelastic |
| Clothing | -0.00 | Consider price increase, demand is highly inelastic |

## Strategic Pricing Initiatives

1. **Dynamic Pricing**: Implement dynamic pricing for highly elastic products
2. **Price Skimming**: For inelastic categories, gradually decrease prices from initial high points
3. **Penetration Pricing**: For elastic categories, start with lower prices to gain market share
4. **Psychological Pricing**: Use price points ending in .99 for elastic products
5. **Bundle Pricing**: Create bundles for complementary products, especially with elastic items
6. **Price Anchoring**: Display premium products alongside standard offerings to increase perception of value
7. **Seasonal Adjustments**: Adjust pricing strategies by season based on the seasonality analysis
